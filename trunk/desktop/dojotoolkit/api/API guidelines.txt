When designing an API, please use this format:

	General rules of thumb:
		
		keep method and property names short but descriptive.
	
	For storage-centric APIs:
	
		use three methods, get(), save(), and remove().
		
		If it is something like a database:
			For filtering, name methods filter(), byId(), and exclude().
			Make sure get(), filter(), byId(), and exclude()
			return a member of the object, named 'objects'
			containing the filtering methods.
		
	For widgets/windows:
		
		To show/hide, use methods named show() and close().
