<h2 class="intro_message">Welcome to Prototype Window Class (PWC)</h2>
<span class="intro_message">New version 1.1 </span><br><br>
Create Window and Dialog has never been so easy :)<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left">

<xmp style="width:95%">  // Create a window
  var win = new Window();
  win.show();
  
  // Create a dialog
  Dialog.alert("Your message");
</xmp>
<br/>
<ul class="intro_message">
  <li> Constructor has been simplified, now you can just do win = new Window(). <br/>
    By default id is automatically generated and can be passed as options<br/>
    <tt>win = new Window({id: "my_id", width: 100, height: 100})</tt> <br/>
    Backward compatibility with old constructor <br/>
    <tt>win = new Window("my_id", {width: 100, height: 100}) </tt></li>
  <li> Observer event can be passed as window option:   <br/></li>
       <tt>win = new Window({onClose: function() {alert('close')}})</tt> 
  <li> parent option can be id or element</li>
  <li> delegate has been removed (not really usefull) and setCloseCallback has been added instead. (It could be also passed as a constructor's option closeCallback: your_callcback)
    your_callcabck must return true to be able to close the window</li>
  <li> add onMove event</li>
  <li> fixed constraint for minimized window</li>
  <li> destroyOnClose could be passed as constructor's option:  <br/><tt>win = new Window({destroyOnClose: true}) </tt></li>
  <li> constraint works for maximized windows</li>
  <li> Dialog ok and cancel parameters has been renamed to onOk and onCancel for coherence (ok and cancel still works)</li>
  <li> Update to Prototype 1.5 and script.aculo.us 1.7</li>
  
</ul>
